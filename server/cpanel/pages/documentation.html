                    The Dataskyline is a interactive information display which can be placed in public areas.
                    It is set up to provide real-time information about the city it is placed in. Passing citizens can
                    interact with the Dataskyline by selecting a different topic using the touch screen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Dataskyline consists of a collection of computers, each with their own display.
                    One of these computers runs a server. All of the Dataskyline's computers run client
                    websites that connect to this server. The server knows certain details about the clients,
                    such as their IP addresses and screen dimensions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Displaying the information is done using small "views" displayed on seperate client displays.
                    These views are generated by installed "modules" which you can <a href="#/documentation#dscms-modules">create yourself</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With this control panel you can install modules, create new topics that can be selected by users,
                    add views to these topics and more.

                    Modules can be created by third party developers and provide the Dataskyline with views that
                    can be placed on the screens. Creating these modules is very easy if you have experience with
                    web development, because they are created using HTML and Javascript. The structure of your module
                    is bound to some restrictions, though. To make sure you stay withing these restrictions when you are creating
                    your own module, we have made a module-creation guide.

                  <h2>Structure</h2>
                  <p>
                    Before you begin, you should know something about the structure of modules. Modules are actually packages
                    of views. A view is the actual application that runs on the Dataskyline. A view can be viewed through
                    windows, which is the name of the cutouts in the white front panel of the Dataskyline.
                  </p>
                  <hr class="hr-dashed" />
                  <h3>Modules</h3>
                  <img class="documentation-subhero img-responsive pull-right" src="cpanel/img/docs/module.png" alt="Module" />
                  <p>
                    A module is used as a container for multiple views and allows you to create different representations of your
                    data, without having to clutter the system with a lot of modules. A module has the following things:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      An x amount of views.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A module <code>info.json</code> file.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    The <code>info.json</code> file should contain information about your module that the system uses to correctly
                    display and use the module. This is what a filled <code>info.json</code> file looks like:
                  </p>
                  <div class="clearfix"></div>
<pre>
{
	"name": "My Module",
	"description": "This module is used to display general info",

                  <hr class="hr-dashed" />
                  <h3>Views</h3>
                  <img class="documentation-subhero img-responsive pull-right" src="cpanel/img/docs/view.png" alt="View" />
                  <p>
                    A view is an application that provides information to be shown on the Dataskyline. A view consists of
                    a Javascript program that may fill windows with the information it provides. At the moment this Javascript
                    program must have all of its functionality inside of <strong>one</strong> <code>.js</code> file.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A view generally comes bundled with one or more windows. Windows are blocks of HTML that are accessible to the
                    Javascript program. More on windows later in the article.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Just like a module, a view also has its own <code>info.json</code> file. This file not only contains information
                    like the view's name and description, but also the location of the view's Javscript program, and a configuration template.
                    More on both later. A filled <code>info.json</code> file looks like this:
                  </p>
                  <div class="clearfix"></div>
<pre>
{
	"name":"My View",
	"description":"Display various graphs of general info",
	"jsProgramUrl":"com.example.module/myview/code.js",
  "configTemplate": {
    "configItems": [
      {
        "key": "config_item_key",
        "name": "human readable title",
        "description": "more information",
        "value": ""
      }
    ]
  }
}
</pre>
                  <hr class="hr-dashed" />
                  <h3>Windows</h3>
                  <img class="documentation-subhero img-responsive pull-right" src="cpanel/img/docs/window.png" alt="Window" />
                  <p>
                    Windows form the visual part of a view. On the Dataskyline, a window is a hole in the white front panel.
                    Windows generally consist of an HTML file and an <code>info.json</code> file. You may note that a window does not
                    have a CSS file. Though you can include it yourself, it is not recommended to do so as CSS files apply to the entire
                    document. This means that you may accidentally change the appearance of windows not related to your view.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A window's <code>info.json</code> file contains information needed to identify the window. It also contains a
                    reference to the window's HTML file. If you want users to see a screenshot of your window in the control panel, you can configure that here as well.
                    A filled <code>info.json</code> file looks like this:
                  </p>
                  <div class="clearfix"></div>
<pre>
{
	"name": "My Window",
	"description": "Display a pie chart",
	"htmlUrl": "com.example.module/myview/mywindow/win.html",
  "preferredWidth": "1920",
  "preferredHeight": "1080",
  "preferredShape": "rectangle",
  "screenshotUrl": "com.example.module/myview/mywindow/screen.png"
}
</pre>
                  <hr class="hr-solid" />
                  <h2>Creating a module</h2>
                  <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
                    <!-- Ew, that link color. Pls fix -->
                    <strong>Hint!</strong> When creating a module for the first time, you should start with the <a href="cpanel/files/startermodule.zip" target="_blank">starter template</a>.
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    As stated above, modules contain views and views contain windows.
                    It is only logical then that your module file structure should look like this:
                  </p>
                  <img class="documentation-medium-img img-responsive pull-left" src="cpanel/img/docs/module-files-finder.png" alt="Module file structure" />
                  <p>
                    As you can see, the structure of a module is very visible in its file structure.
                    You can of course create as many views and windows as you like, as long as you use this
                    file structure. Keep in mind that a module, view and window always need <code>info.json</code>
                    files, structured as specified in the previous chapter.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Writing a view's Javascript program</h3>
                  <p>
                    The client software heavily depends on <a href="https://angularjs.org">Angular.JS</a>. Your code is executed
                    within the scope of an instance of the "dscmsViewCtrl" controller. For people unfamiliar with Angular.JS: your code
                    will be scoped and the functions you create will only be accessible by yourself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We provide your Javascript program with a couple of things.
                  </p>
                  <h4>DSCMSView</h4>
                  <p>
                    The DSCMSView object allows you to implement a function called "run" that will be executed when all of your view's
                    windows have been loaded on the screen. If you want to modify the content on screen, you should do it
                    from this function.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You use the function like this:
                  </p>
<pre>
DSCMSView.run = function() {
  // Your DOM manipulating code
}
</pre>
                  <h4>DSCMSViewTools</h4>
                  <p>
                    The DSCMSViewTools contains many objects that are provided by the Dataskyline system to help you
                    reach your windows and settings. The objects provided by DSCMSViewTools are:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <h5>myName</h5>
                      <p>
                        The myName property contains the name of your view.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <h5>myParentModule</h5>
                      <p>
                        The myParentModule property contains the name of your view's parent module.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <h5>myWindows</h5>
                      <p>
                        The myWindows property contains a list of the unique identifiers of your view instance's
                        windows. The ID's are stored in key-value pairs, where the name of the window as defined in
                        the window's <code>info.json</code> file is used as key.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <h5>myConfig</h5>
                      <p>
                        The myConfig property contains a filled configuration object for that instance of your view.
                        The view instance can be configurated from the control panel and its options are based on the ones
                        you specified in the view's <code>info.json</code> file.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <h5>myAddress</h5>
                      <p>
                        The myAddress property contains the path to the view's folder on the server. This is very handy to have
                        if you want to include images or stylesheets.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4>$http</h4>
                  <p>
                    We have opened up the Angular $http API to your Javascript application.
                    For more information look <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http">here</a>.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Other libraries</h4>
                  <p>
                    You might want to use some popular libraries to make development easier or to quickly generate UI elements.
                    Because we only support a single Javascript file for your program, this can become quite the hassle. This is why
                    we have already included several libraries for you to use:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>JQuery 1.11.3</li>
                    <li>Angular.JS 1.4.5 (more on this later)</li>
                    <li>Bootstrap 3.3.2</li>
                    <li>D3 v3</li>
                  </ul>
                  <div class="panel panel-default">
                      <div class="panel-body">
                        <h4>Using Angular.JS in your program</h4>
                        <p>
                          You can only use certain aspects of Angular.JS in your program:
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              The $scope, avoiding the use of the "dscms" namespace. Please note that your application is not executed
                              in the same thread as Angular.JS. When changing $scope variables you'll have to call
                              <code>$scope.$apply()</code> to update the web page.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              The $http API.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              All HTML attributes or elements, such as ng-repeat and ng-bind, with the exception of ng-controller.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                        </p>
                      </div>
                  </div>

                  <hr class="hr-dashed" />
                  <h3>Making windows</h3>
                  <p>
                    When you create an instance of a view, you have to select where you want to place the view's windows.
                    The system then knows where to place <code>div</code> elements, which will be filled with the contents
                    of your window's HTML files.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Windows are <mark>not</mark> full web pages. You shouln't use <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, etc tags in your windows.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You are free to do whatever you want inside a window's HTML file, but please avoid linking css files or writing inline Javascript.
                    The Dataskyline will probably handle this correctly, but you could very easily be stepping into other views' functionality.
                  </p>

                    display a map of a city with a weather forecast, bar charts with temperature per hour or wind speed.

                  <h2>Creating a topic</h2>
                  <p>
                    To create a new topic all you need to do is click on the “+” on the top of the table of topics. In the popup that
                    opens up, you need to enter a name for your topic and a description. Neither of these fields can be empty and
                    there can not be an existing topic with the same name. After entering the name and description you can click
                    the “Add topic” button. And you’re done, simple as that!

                  <p>
                    Now for the exciting part. After creating a new topic, you get to configure it. To start doing so, click
                    on the edit button next to your topic. (It’s the button with the pencil on it). In the top-right corner you’ll
                    find a dropdown menu from where you can select the screen you wish to edit. If you’re editing a new topic,
                    you’ll see there are no instances configured fort his screen. To add a new instance you can click the “+”
                    button on the right of the screen. A popup window will show from where you can pick a view (You will have to
                    have at least one module installed, since the views shown are loaded from the installed modules). You’ll also
                    need to name the instance of your view before clicking the “Add view” button to add the view to the screen.
                    The window table will now show the window(s) you just added to the screen. To change the position of a window,
                    you have to click the pencil button to the left of the window you want to edit and pick an empty window on the
                    left side of the screen. Keep doing this until you’re satisfied with the screen and move on to the next screen!
                    Don’t forget to save your topic when you’re done, by clicking the save button in the top right corner.
